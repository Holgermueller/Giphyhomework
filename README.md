## Prerequisites and installation
This project requires not extensions. However, it does require the jQuery
CDN, which can be obtained here: [jQuery CDN](https://code.jquery.com/)
It also requires an API key from Giphy, which can be obtained here:
[Giphy API Key](https://developers.giphy.com/)

## What it does:
Click any one of the buttons on the screen to receive a
selection of GIFs featuring the animal on that buttons name.

## What if my favorite animal doesn't have a button?
Enter the name of your favorite animal into the provided input field and 
click the SUBMIT button. This will create a custom button for you to click to your
heart's content.

## How does it work?
This app makes an AJAX call using an API key provided by GIPHY.

## Does this mean I can search for GIFs of things other than animals?
Technically, yes, but the point of this app is to search for GIFs featuring
animals. Why would you use this app if you wanted to search for something other than 
animal GIFs?

## Why isn't the GIF doing anything?
Just hover your cursor over the image. It'll begin moving in a moment.

## Have a favorite?
Just click the button labelled 'Favorite', and the gif will be saved to local storage 
and displayed at the bottom of the app for your viewing pleasure.

## See a GIF you can't live without?
Click the download button, and it's yours.
